At first, the streams slipped through his grasp, scattering before his focus could take hold. Slowly, the water began to respond, curling and flowing around his hands like living silk.\n\nOne afternoon, while {Player} trained in the forest, he noticed {VillageGirl}, a young villager girl, watching him. Before they could speak, a massive, enraged wild boar burst from the underbrush, charging straight at her.\n\nWater surged at {Player}’s command, forming a twisting barrier that knocked the boar off its charge. The creature stumbled and fell back, stunned by the force. With a final wave, he sent a torrent rushing forward, driving it into the woods. The forest fell silent as {VillageGirl}’s wide eyes met his.",
