As he ran deeper into the wilds, the sounds of fire and battle faded away behind him. Soon enough, only silence remained.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, however, the hunters would be saved by an {Kingdom#Adjective} knight who was patrolling the forest that day. Days later, this knight would track {Player} down, introducing herself by the name of {Knight1}. {Player} would try to evade her grasp, but his underdeveloped magical powers were no match for a knight's professional training. After capturing {Player}, {Knight1} was determined to bring him to {Capital1}, the royal capital of the kingdom of {Kingdom#Name}. This long journey would take at least two whole months, during which, {Player} learns some rudimentary language skills from his captors.\n\nHowever, just before the escort could reach {Capital1}, they were attacked by a {Monster2}, an aggressive magical beast with the body of a lion, and the head and wings of an eagle. During this attack, the {Monster2} killed all of the escorting men, gravely wounded {Knight1}, and tore a large hole in the cage where {Player} was held.",
