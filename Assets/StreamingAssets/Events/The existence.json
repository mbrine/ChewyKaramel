Memories long hidden, fragments of a past he never knew, flashed before his eyes—visions of celestial light, wings that never fully formed, and an essence not human. He realized with a shock that he was an angel, yet without angelic traits, a deviation of creation itself. The knowledge settled like both a weight and a revelation: he was unique, incomplete, and powerful in ways he had never understood.\n\nWith this clarity, {Player} saw two paths before him. One led into an endless journey, a quest to discover a place in the world where he truly belonged. The other offered a return to the kingdom, to face his origin and find reconciliation with those who loved him, despite the truth of his unnatural existence.",
