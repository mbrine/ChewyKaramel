The old woman’s words echoed in his mind, gentle but fading with every step: some truths are meant to be left behind.\n\nHe returned to {Kingdom#Name}, greeted once more by familiar halls and faces. Life resumed its rhythm, the laughter of courtiers, the music in the palace, and the weight of royal duties. The visions, the whispers, and the pulsing book became a distant memory, like a half-forgotten dream upon waking.\n\nYet in quiet moments, when the moonlight touched the palace towers just so, {Player} sometimes felt a faint stir inside him, a whisper of what could have been. He smiled and continued on, choosing the life he knew, living fully as a prince, embracing the peace of a world unburdened by the mysteries of the sky.\n\nIn choosing the ordinary, he discovered a different kind of strength, the courage to live without the weight of the unknown, and the grace to cherish what was already his.",
