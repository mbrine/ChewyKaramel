What are you doing?”\n\n{Player} hesitated only a moment before sprinting past. The figure shouted, but made no attempt to strike, allowing {Player} to dart through the corridor. He weaved between pillars and leapt over debris, heart pounding as he burst through the cathedral doors. The cool night air hit his face, and he disappeared into the streets beyond, leaving the grand hall and its questions behind.",
