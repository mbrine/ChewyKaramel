The nobles, itching for a chance to fight {Player} and humiliate him publicly, wasted no time accepting his offer. However, not even the most expensive gear and exclusive mentorship in the world could hold a candle to {Player}â€™ angelic powers. The tournament was won overwhelmingly in his favour. Seeing this, the principal decided to give {Player} another chance. He would go on to graduate from {Capital1} Academy with full honours and, after some years, become a fearsome commander of the {Kingdom#Adjective} army.\n\n{Player} would meet the knight {Knight1} again during the height of the {Kingdom#Adjective} Crusades, a series of long and bloody wars fought by the kingdom of {Kingdom#Name} against its opponents. At the aftermath of one such battle, {Knight1} approached {Player} and asked him if this was what he wanted.",
