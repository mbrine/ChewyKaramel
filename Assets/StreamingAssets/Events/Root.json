The angels are described as {_Random:magical beings of great power|omniscient overseers|devils in a different suit}, humanoids with dark horns and pure white wings. Since the beginning, they ruled over humanity with an iron fist, subjugating them to their will. The humans, in turn, worshipped them, and that was the way of things for a very long time.\n\n{_Random:But once,|Fate is a funny thing, however,|One day, everything would change when} an Angel was born without horns or wings. Externally, it was indistinguishable from a human child. This flaw was deemed unacceptable for the Angels; it was cast out of its birthplace, and left to fend for itself in the wilds.\n\n{_Random:He was named {Player}|{Player} was his name|Legend will tell of the great {Player}}, and this is where his story begins.",
