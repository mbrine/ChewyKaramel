Sadness bled into rage, rage at his adoptive father, who had so easily cast him aside, and at the priests who stood with their smug, untouchable grace. Who were these men, clad in white and draped in holiness, to decide his fate?\n\nWithout thinking, {Player} lunged toward one of the priests. He who had no combat training his entire life, could only muster a punch that would barely hurt anyone, but how much damage {Player} can do to the priest does not matter. A beam of light shot from the priest’s finger, searing through {Player}’s body.  “Make no mistake, filth” the priest said coldly. “We dont know how you toyed with the angel’s power, but we have been blessed with this power directly, honed from the moment we dedicate our life to our master-”.\n\nThe priest continues rambling about his devotion, but it does not matter. {Player}’s world was slowly going dark and the last thing he heard was the sound of his cold lifeless body slumping onto the ground.",
