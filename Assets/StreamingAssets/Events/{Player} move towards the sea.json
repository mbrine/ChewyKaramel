He rose with the sun each morning, mending nets, tending small boats, and casting his line into the ocean, learning the rhythm of the tides and the patience of the sea.\n\nThe villagers barely knew of his past, and he never volunteered the story. Life became simple, almost ordinary, yet it carried a quiet peace that {Player} had never known. The horizon stretched endlessly before him, waves crashing softly against the shore, and for the first time in his life, he felt the strange relief of days passing without fear, without pursuit, and without the weight of power he could not yet control.",
