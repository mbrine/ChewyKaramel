The historian, {HistorianName}, listened intently as {Player} explained his purpose. Though details of that night had long faded into rumor, the scholar recalled one crucial fact: the Queen’s fateful stroll had taken place deep within {Forest1}, near the outskirts of {VillageName}. Records of that region were scarce, and few dared venture there since. \n\nThanking the historian, {Player} felt a faint spark of direction, his path was finally beginning to take shape. Another thought flashed into his mind: the Captain of the Royal Guard had been part of his mother’s escort that day. Perhaps he could provide further insight… or he could make haste for {VillageName}.",
