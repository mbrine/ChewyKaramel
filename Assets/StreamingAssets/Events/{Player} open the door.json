They led him through the dim corridors of the castle, where the silence felt sharper than any accusation./n/nIn the throne room, the king and queen awaited, their expressions grave. Before them stood several priests of the Angelic Order, their relics faintly glowing with divine light. They had come at the command of their Angelic master, sent to trace a disturbance in the divine balance and their search had led them here. The faint signature of celestial power clung to {Player}, exposing the truth he had never meant to reveal.\n\nThe king's judgment came swiftly, his decision absolute. Guards stepped forward as the sentence was delivered. {Player} was to be imprisoned and executed at dawn.",
