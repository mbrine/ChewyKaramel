We were sent by the Angel we serve to investigate.”\nThe king’s face hardened. “Send him to the prison. He is to be executed at dawn.”\n“A wise choice, my king,” said another priest. “It would not serve your kingdom well if our master were to discover what kind of entity you have been harboring all these years.” ",
