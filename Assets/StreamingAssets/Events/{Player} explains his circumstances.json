There is something in me that is related to angels.”\n\nThe stranger's eyes flicked to the relic, then back to him, a slow curiosity replacing suspicion. The glow dimmed slightly, as if the relic itself listened. “You spoke plain,“ the stranger said. “Good. I have little time for secrets.“ He tucked the relic away and stepped closer, lowering his voice. “I am part of a small band that opposes the Angels' rule. If what you say is true, you could be useful not as a weapon, but as proof that their light can be turned. Come with me. There are others who will definitely welcome you as an ally.“\n\nHe gestured down a narrow passage that opened from the courtyard, shadowed and deliberate. “All of us have grudges towards the angels and we wont consider you as one of them. Seeing how you are here, there must be some circumstances behind your origins as well.“\n\n{Player} took a deep breath, sensing that this moment was only the first step toward a destiny far greater than he had ever imagined.",
