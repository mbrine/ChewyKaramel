He was discovered by border guards and subsequently captured, leading to his internment at {Site1}, a holding site for refugees from neighbouring regions. There, {Player} piqued the interest of government personnel, who was curious about his lack of connection to any family members and strange magical powers. He was then transferred to {Lab1}, an underground research facility within {Capital1}.\n\nThere, {Player} was relentlessly experimented upon by {Kingdom#Adjective} scientists who wanted to find the source of his power and recreate it for themselves. However, many such attempts would fail. Driven by desperation, a scientist by the name of {Scientist} devised a brand new procedure in which {Player} would be subjected to a concoction of dangerous chemicals.",
