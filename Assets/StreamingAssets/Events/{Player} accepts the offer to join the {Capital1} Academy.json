His days are spent working on physical exercises; running long distances, striking wooden dummies, learning magic techniques, so on and so forth. His performance rapidly exceeded that of his peers, so much so that by the second year of his training, he was going toe-to-toe with seniors in their final year. {Player} quickly rose to become the top ranking student in his cohort. His remarkable achievements caught the attention of the professors at the academy, but also the jealousy of the nobles, who were accustomed to being at the top of the pecking order. The nobles conspired to get {Player} expelled from the academy by accusing him of various misconducts, even resorting to bribing the school staff to side with them.",
