Suddenly, a hand grabbed him from behind, pulling him away from the inferno. The hand belonged to {VillageGirl}, and together they ran toward the nearby stream.\n\nAs they neared the river, a massive figure flashed behind {VillageGirl} and struck her down. It was the same Angel he had seen in the village square. The creature wielded a greatsword with a crimson-red blade, its aura radiating deadly power.",
