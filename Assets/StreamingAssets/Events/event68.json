The bells rang with a solemn rhythm, echoing across marble towers and gilded spires, their sound both haunting and magnetic. Each strike seemed to tug at something deep within him, a reminder of the power he carried and the world he had left behind.\n\nAs he approached the source, the streets grew quieter, almost empty, save for a few late-night patrols and servants hurrying along their duties. The bells led him to a massive cathedral at the heart of the capital, its doors carved with intricate depictions of Angels in flight. A faint glow spilled from the entrance, casting long, ethereal shadows across the plaza.\n\n{Player} paused at the threshold, feeling the hum of magic in the air. The bells rang once more, their sound vibrating through the ground.",
