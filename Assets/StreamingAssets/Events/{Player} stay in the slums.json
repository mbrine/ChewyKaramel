The air was thick with the stench of smoke and stagnant water, and the narrow streets twisted like a maze. He wandered aimlessly, passing beggars huddled by fires and traders dealing in scraps.\n\nAs he loitered near an abandoned tavern, a voice called out from behind. “You don’t belong here, stranger.” Before {Player} could turn, a blade flashed past his shoulder. He stumbled back, catching sight of a ragged man with eyes wild from hunger. The attacker lunged again this time, the knife finding its mark.\n\n{Player} collapsed against the wall, the world dimming as footsteps faded into the night. The city’s bells rang faintly in the distance, marking another life quietly lost in the slums.",
