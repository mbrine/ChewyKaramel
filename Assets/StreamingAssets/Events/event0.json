The chamber faded into a realm that felt impossibly vast, a place that did not seem to obey the laws of reality. Floating islands drifted across skies painted with impossible colors, and the air hummed with a strange resonance. In the distance, a figure descended from above, wings gleaming and shadowed, radiating both beauty and terror.\n\nThe angel, {Angel1}, looked down at {Player} with eyes that pierced into his soul. \"You are a failure,\" it whispered, its voice both melodic and cruel, \"an angel without wings, without purpose, a deviation from what should have been.\" \n\nBefore {Player} could react, two paths became clear: confront the angel in battle, risking everything to prove himself, or flee, attempting to escape the angel’s domain and the unknown consequences of defiance.",
