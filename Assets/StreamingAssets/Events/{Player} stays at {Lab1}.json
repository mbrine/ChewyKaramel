As the concoction was injected into him, he felt a tremendous amount of pain and physical trauma. This mysterious blend of chemicals, combined with his angelic blood, turned {Player} into an uncontrollable monster. In an instant, everyone in the room was ripped apart and smeared across the walls. However, this transformation would not last long. {Player} collapsed shortly after, never to wake again. In the aftermath of this incident, his name was struck from the records, information about him was redacted, and soon, he was forgotten.\n\n{Player} would go down in the annals of history as an anomaly, an unsolved mystery, an experiment which never bore fruit.",
