Sparks flew, walls rippled, and candles shattered as energy crackled through the air.\n\nThe robed figures fired beams of white magic, but {Player} twisted and leapt, sending his own power in return. In a final surge, he unleashed a blinding wave from the sigil, knocking them back and shattering the cathedral into fire, smoke, and marble shards.\n\nWhen the brilliance faded, the cathedral lay in ruin. Smoke curled from broken candles, and marble shards littered the floor. {Player} stood at the center, chest heaving, glowing faintly from the residual energy, alone amidst the aftermath.\n\nBy seizing the power of the sigil and reducing the cathedral to rubble, {Player} had marked himself as a force the Angels could no longer ignore. Rumors would spread of a half-Angel capable of wielding their sacred power, and secret alliances and rivalries would stir in the shadows. In that single night, the balance of the world had shifted, and the consequences of his actions would ripple far beyond the ruined halls he left behind.",
