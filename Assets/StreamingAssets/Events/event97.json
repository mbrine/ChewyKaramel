Through the flames, he saw a massive Angel standing in the village square, wings spread wide and eyes cold.\n\n“This village defies our rule,” it said. “Purge them and remind all that defiance will not be tolerated.”\n\n{Player} froze at the overwhelming presence of the creature. Suddenly, a hand grabbed him from behind, pulling him away from the inferno. The hand belonged to {VillageGirl}, and together they ran toward the nearby stream.\n\nAs they neared the river, a massive figure flashed behind {VillageGirl} and struck her down. It was the same Angel he had seen in the village square. The creature wielded a greatsword with a crimson-red blade, its aura radiating deadly power.",
