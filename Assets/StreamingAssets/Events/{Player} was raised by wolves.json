After all, Angels were supposed to have horns and wings! All the hunters saw was a feral boy with unusual magic powers.\n\nIn an attempt to bring {Player} back to the kingdom for scientific study, the hunters chased him through the forest for days on end. This chase eventually led them into the territory of a fearsome predator: the three-headed, fire-breathing {Monster1}. As the hunters were being attacked, they let out a cry for help.",
