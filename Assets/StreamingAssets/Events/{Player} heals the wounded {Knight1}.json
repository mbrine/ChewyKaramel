When the two arrive at {Capital1}, they are welcomed by the guards and stationed in holding site by the name of {Site1}, to await further orders. {Knight1} later learns that {Player} was going to be taken away to a remote research facility within inner {Capital1}, known for cruel methods of experimentation. She pleads with her superiors to reconsider their decision, stating that she would not be alive without him, making an appeal to morality.\n\nThe {Kingdom#Adjective} high command, upon hearing about this, decides to give {Player} a chance to integrate into society. A few months later, {Player} was given the chance to be enrolled at the {Capital1} Military Academy, where young {Kingdom#Adjective} citizens learn to become fledgeling soldiers for their kingdom.",
