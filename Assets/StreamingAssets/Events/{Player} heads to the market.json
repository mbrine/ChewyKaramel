Lanterns hung from beams and stalls, filling the streets with a soft golden glow. Merchants called out to customers, bartering over fruit, fabrics, and trinkets, while the smell of roasted food mingled with the cool sea air.\n\n{Player} wandered through the lively crowd, taking in the sights and sounds. After days of travel, the warmth and noise of the market felt almost comforting. But from the corner of his eye, he caught a flicker of movement a figure watching him from behind a stall.\n\nWhen {Player} turned to look, the figure immediately darted away into a side alley.",
