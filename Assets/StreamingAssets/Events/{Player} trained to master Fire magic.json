At first, the magic flickered weakly, sputtering out before it could take form. Slowly, the flames began to obey, swirling and dancing in rhythm with his breath.\n\nOne afternoon, while {Player} trained in the forest, he noticed {VillageGirl}, a young villager girl, watching him. Before they could speak, a massive, enraged wild boar burst from the underbrush, charging straight at her.\n\nFlames erupted from {Player}’s palms, forming a wall between {VillageGirl} and the boar. The creature recoiled, but his fear fed the fire until it roared. With a final burst, he drove the boar back into the woods. Smoke hung in the air as {VillageGirl}’s wide eyes met his.",
